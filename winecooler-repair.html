                <h2>We are the bearers of genuine parts to repair the wine cooler with a guarantee!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The wine coolers have thermally insulated parts which maintain the best possible temperature for the wines. You should store wine at the correct temperature to ensure a wine’s flavor and the balance remains. You don’t want a wine to age prematurely or be ruined by its storage conditions, so it is essential to know the optimal wine storage temperatures and conditions for your bottles of wine. Extreme fluctuations in temperature most often damage wines. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The perfect temperature depends on various factors, including how much fruit, alcohol, and tannin the wine contains. As a general rule of thumb, wine should be stored around 11-14˚c (52-57°F). Wine storage temperatures should never go over 24˚c as otherwise, wines begin to oxidize, which negatively affects the wine. To retrieve the proper functioning of your wine cooler our genuine repairing parts do an exceptional job to give you that brand new essence of the appliance.
